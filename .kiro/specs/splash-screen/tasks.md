- [x] 2. Implement logo fade-in animation





  - Add AnimationController for logo fade-in effect
  - Create FadeTransition widget wrapping the CineLogLogo
  - Configure animation duration and curve for smooth effect
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Add text slide-up animation for app name



  - Implement second AnimationController for text animation
  - Create SlideTransition for "CineLog" text with upward movement
  - Style text to match app branding with proper typography
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Implement automatic navigation timing





  - Add Timer to control splash screen display duration
  - Implement navigation to HomeScreen after specified duration
  - Ensure proper cleanup of timers and animation controllers
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Add smooth screen transition animation











  - Create custom PageRouteBuilder for fade transition to home screen
  - Implement smooth fade-out effect when leaving splash screen
  - Test transition timing to ensure it feels natural
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 6. Configure app to use splash screen as initial route












  - Update `lib/main.dart` to set SplashScreen as home route
  - Modify MaterialApp routing to handle splash â†’ home navigation
  - Ensure proper route management and back button behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [x] 7. Add configuration options for splash screen behavior

  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 9. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms





  - Implement try-catch blocks around animation initialization
  - Add fallback static display if animations fail
  - Ensure navigation always occurs even if animations fail
  - _Requirements: 4.4_

- [x] 10. Write unit tests for splash screen functionality













  - Test animation controller initialization and disposal
  - Test timer functionality and navigation triggering
  - Test responsive sizing calculations and configuration handling
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
- [x] 11. Write widget tests for UI components














- [ ] 11. Write widget tests for UI components

  - Test splash screen rendering with different configurations
