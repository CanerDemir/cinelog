# Design Document

## Overview

The splash screen will be implemented as a dedicated Flutter screen that displays immediately when the app launches. It will feature the CineLog logo with smooth animations and automatically transition to the home screen. The design maintains consistency with the existing app theme while providing an engaging launch experience.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
SplashScreen (StatefulWidget)
├── AnimationController (for logo fade-in)
├── AnimationController (for text slide-up)
├── Timer (for auto-transition)
└── Navigator (for screen transition)
```

### Screen Flow
1. App Launch → SplashScreen
2. SplashScreen → HomeScreen (after animations + timer)

### File Organization
- `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` - Main splash screen implementation
- Update `lib/main.dart` - Set splash screen as initial route
- Reuse `lib/widgets/cinelog_logo.dart` - Existing logo widget

## Components and Interfaces

### SplashScreen Widget
```dart
class SplashScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final Duration displayDuration;
  final bool skipInDebug;
  
  const SplashScreen({
    Key? key,
    this.displayDuration = const Duration(seconds: 3),
    this.skipInDebug = false,
  }) : super(key: key);
}
```

### Animation Controllers
- **Logo Animation**: FadeTransition for logo appearance (0.8 seconds)
- **Text Animation**: SlideTransition for "CineLog" text (0.6 seconds, starts after logo)
- **Screen Transition**: PageRouteBuilder with fade transition (0.5 seconds)

### Layout Structure
```
Scaffold
└── Container (background: #1A1D29)
    └── Center
        └── Column
            ├── AnimatedBuilder (logo fade-in)
            │   └── CineLogLogo(size: responsive)
            ├── SizedBox (spacing)
            └── AnimatedBuilder (text slide-up)
                └── Text("CineLog", style: branded)
```

## Data Models

### Configuration
```dart
class SplashConfig {
  final Duration displayDuration;
  final Duration logoAnimationDuration;
  final Duration textAnimationDuration;
  final Duration transitionDuration;
  final bool skipInDebug;
}
```

No persistent data storage required - splash screen is purely presentational.

## Error Handling

### Animation Failures
- If animations fail to initialize, display static logo and text
- Ensure timer still triggers navigation after specified duration
- Log animation errors for debugging

### Navigation Failures
- Implement fallback navigation using Navigator.pushReplacement
- Handle potential route errors gracefully
- Ensure user never gets stuck on splash screen

### Asset Loading
- Use existing CineLogLogo widget which has built-in error handling
- Fallback to text-only display if logo fails to load
- Maintain consistent timing regardless of asset loading issues

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test animation controller initialization and disposal
- Test timer functionality and navigation triggering
- Test responsive logo sizing calculations
- Test configuration parameter handling

### Widget Tests
- Test splash screen rendering with different configurations
- Test animation sequences and timing
- Test navigation behavior after timer completion
- Test error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Test complete app launch flow from splash to home screen
- Test splash screen on different screen sizes
- Test performance impact of animations
- Test behavior in debug vs release modes

### Manual Testing
- Verify smooth animations on physical devices
- Test on various screen sizes and orientations
- Verify timing feels appropriate for user experience
- Test app launch performance impact

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Use efficient animation curves (Curves.easeInOut)
- Dispose animation controllers properly to prevent memory leaks
- Minimize splash screen impact on app startup time
- Consider using SingleTickerProviderStateMixin for single animation controller

### Accessibility
- Ensure splash screen doesn't interfere with screen readers
- Provide semantic labels for logo and text elements
- Consider users who prefer reduced motion
- Maintain sufficient color contrast

### Platform Considerations
- Test on both Android and iOS for consistent behavior
- Consider platform-specific launch behavior
- Ensure splash screen works with Flutter web if applicable
- Handle different device pixel ratios appropriately

### Responsive Design
- Logo size: 25% of screen width (min: 80px, max: 150px)
- Text size: Responsive based on screen width
- Maintain proper spacing ratios across devices
- Center content both horizontally and vertically
