## Introduction

This feature adds a splash screen to the CineLog app that displays when the app launches. The splash screen will showcase the CineLog logo with smooth animations and transitions, providing a polished user experience while the app initializes. The design will be inspired by the existing logo and maintain consistency with the app's dark theme and orange accent color.
